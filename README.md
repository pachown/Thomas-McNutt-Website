## Summary

This is my Portfolio website. It has an about me page, an algorithm blog, a projects page, and an outreach page so that you can get in touch with me!
  
The npm packages I used to help me out are show-code and react-burger-menu. Making the latter work on Next.js was quite an enjoyable problem solving process and I look forward to using it again in the future.
